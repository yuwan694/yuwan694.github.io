# Echo Reviews

### [Alpaca Basic Subscription](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vQJDXYdoSk7kIJJcBP5aqtKB76PaXB3_yb_-xhUBA_vs9Q-20QsoPT319unoRygO-kicSFXVvTZ3VaR/pub)
I spent some time reviewing alpaca market data sdk, and now it is time to create an account to do more reviews. I’ll go for the basic subscription to begin with. This subscription will let me generate an api key, to explore more features alpaca supports.

### [Echo-Review Tools (ervTools) Python Package](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vRJk1UCyUG5eshAMjtI57gzkd4Bwf6oBooKaNB8ETQI_dP2dM8QbxlaZ4_nbxVD39VxyFm9SN1Whs9R/pub)
While I was doing echo-review for Alpaca Crypto Bar Market Data, I realised I needed to write the common tools python package for Echo Reviews. With this package, I’ll generate standard library documents and register to pip registry

### [Alpaca Crypto Bar Market Data](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vSbO0Z71FGjZoAHNtqJCIjSdJyvg8Num48C_SKdutLMPdZa9bkfKp11N0Pjbe9GuUlmEgL1ekTcB3qz/pub)
The very first Alpaca SDK evaluation is about getting Crypto Bar Market Data from alpaca service. The implementation class is CryptoBar, and I made the initialisation function to take all the key word arguments as the spec for the class. So that the caller can specify the different requests when constructing the CryptoBar class.

### [VSCode Extension for Unit Test](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vQDoSAk7cFIkyfUVZ-vzg4MB0Fax_XKz_f2yOcyW_PJ3lB95XqxGCdtX4uObwgwmTcmGcvo_1wHutW8/pub)
As I have shown in the Alpaca Crypto Bar Market Data echo-review, it is very useful having the unit test class in the same script with the implementation class, and if you can run each unit test right away from the code.

### [Using VSCode for Python](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vTO0qs19g1TFRSKFeg3Rdo4wpBodCBolCwpk0rNY4CK8aSoPDoYtAsH2OM4Ozzr_nEp4f1uOR1GYurt/pub)
This is part of the evaluation of alpaca sdk, and I’ll start using VSCode for the python repo created for it. During the creation of the python repo, I just used the command line and web interface, but in actual development I have used VSCode since 2023. The previous tool I’ve used PyCharm from JetBrains was also good, but I think VSCode is better.

### [Create a new repo for a python project](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vTC_sEQaTS1hDEwW21iwXDcCElZQb0jiNG4RPP-5gmwDHSZU-L6OtyiP1SRTMVHN8ObO2AvS7r9R_uM/pub)
I’ll create a new repo for Alpaca SDK evaluation, but any python package repo could be started in the same way. I’ll use a virtual environment for a python project, and will add minimal necessary files in the beginning. In this case, I’ll use GitLab for the remote repo service.
