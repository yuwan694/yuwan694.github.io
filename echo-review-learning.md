### [Echo Review, the way I learn everything](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vT3XmPU6_6sVhs-OJdU31uEXHULB6Q0THjeCuIE960bZsoL6LQf3gzV2G0a5CC3laNz_x9-dtYFtJrG/pub)
It is a learning activity by redoing what I have learned, and logging all the progress. It is not just reading, but doing it myself once again. The effective learning is not happening when I read and understand the material. That is mostly happening when I do it myself, and sometimes when I struggle because of many unexpected failures while doing it.

### [Introduction to Data Science with Python](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vSosZ0-gGkIo6pfqC0ZacUfaULh2DPhNGgfF5Hlyf4MOUW_zDvwePgiFj1yQVjMwMONOPAZuupvI3l4/pub)
As a part of the preparation for the python job interview, I decided to take an audit course for the “Introduction to Data Science with Python” in Harvard edX, CS109x. It is in audit mode, so it is a free course. I just need to know some details about what I am still missing in data science, after spending over 6 years of data processing and analysis.
