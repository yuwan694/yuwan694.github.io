### [Echo Review, the way I learn everything](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vT3XmPU6_6sVhs-OJdU31uEXHULB6Q0THjeCuIE960bZsoL6LQf3gzV2G0a5CC3laNz_x9-dtYFtJrG/pub)
It is a learning activity by redoing what I have learned, and logging all the progress. It is not just reading, but doing it myself once again. The effective learning is not happening when I read and understand the material. That is mostly happening when I do it myself, and sometimes when I struggle because of many unexpected failures while doing it.

### [Implementing Algorithms in Python](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vTcWGuHK1tvGFFBvSpOOCHmrVSUQxgPeSUaIZEV8758mrs_wzd1VcLxUmc9Vi7XCPKDBXfv9HpidOPL/pub)
I’ve used C/C++, Shell, PHP, Perl, Java, Python, and some other computer languages as well. But I am not a computer science major, so my understanding is a bit limited in algorithms. Maybe that is why I feel difficulties in coding tests during the interview process, as they normally ask to implement some quick algorithm. I don’t think knowledge of algorithms is really necessary for the work, but it is demanded during the interview process.

### [Python Basics and Findings](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vQeiLfkmAiZZaj9aZxCprU7ntcxGKRFcA2iJWwefV3Nc10dfNpDmrkYe4kJooup2hlrBRu_ZXbKFT_-/pub)
I am checking the python basics to answer the interview questions. I have used python for more than 7 years by now, but still there’s many features I have never visited. I’ll take this chance to cover the general basic concepts and features of the Python language. To start I have searched for frequent python interview questions, and tackle them one by one.

### [Detour, Getting back my C++ skill](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vQnnvB2uWregplqjPpoUtBKDHc4cCAiSB2u7KtPfyaqYHlsSAoj3H2SxMAQnPb2NrIsGT_Grwj0XNfj/pub)
I was an analyst for the last 6 years or so, and barely did some C++ work. What I remember is only the Onload OOO Sending feature in R1, and IP Frag Verification done in early 2025. In other times, I was mostly Python/Pandas/Matplotlib developer and Performance Engineer, who was following the performance issues. During the interview process, however, I found people still want me to have some level of C++ skills. So I’ll reclaim my C++ skill with this Detour project.

### [Introduction to Data Science with Python](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vSosZ0-gGkIo6pfqC0ZacUfaULh2DPhNGgfF5Hlyf4MOUW_zDvwePgiFj1yQVjMwMONOPAZuupvI3l4/pub)
As a part of the preparation for the python job interview, I decided to take an audit course for the “Introduction to Data Science with Python” in Harvard edX, CS109x. It is in audit mode, so it is a free course. I just need to know some details about what I am still missing in data science, after spending over 6 years of data processing and analysis.
