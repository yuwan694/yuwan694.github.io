### [It looks like a stupid decision made](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10NxKYKiZ9K07GFEFf67HKvoDOBZ0UzLyPizrPNE7Bk4/)
But it is not. It just looked like that, because people or even myself do not really see what is the difference. So whenever a new factor is added into the scene, it looks like a stupid decision made on top of the all visible evidence. The only guy who sees the invisible factor is only me in many cases, that is why people around me think the decision questionable. That is quite a noise to me, as I still wasn’t fully convinced yet either.

### [The reason why I cannot find right job (why am I stuck?)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1P77QRRM9-NHzt9LgRVX_kU3-swzoy2JSqe9lWpzVK6o/)
I was working in the financial industry for 15 years, and it feels like suddenly I have no job opportunities to apply. Why is that? (...) The self-employed crypto trader is enjoyable, but there are missing pieces in this life.

### [My Competitiveness in Financial Industry](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1D8CnpBr7l2ef13bJkrIlhdTa32pU1cxldei3J7-HcRY/)
I worked for the financial industry for 15 years by now, and I’ve been a developer and a performance engineer during this time, and later I built a refutation as an MMS analysis for KRX market. The developer career has faded out, as I had less time to work on that area, and my C++ skill rusted out time ago. So I am now a performance and MMS analyst, but it seems pretty hard to explain myself in the job market. Why is that? I felt strange recently, so I decided to list my strengths in this area.

### [My 3rd Engineering Life](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1t70aOjQC4XLip3736tQQNfzWjoDI1NCdb1OTb-F2GHs/)
This year, 2025, I can see my engineering life is changing. The first engineering life was 17 years in Korea, and the second one was 15 years in Australia. I am still living in Sydney, but it seems my engineering life is progressing to the 3rd one. It will be another 15 to 20 years, but it will be very different from the previous two.
