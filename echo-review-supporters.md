The echo-review is my personal endeavour for continuous learning, evaluation, and verification of knowledge available publicly. But sometimes I put a lot of time and effort into creating documents, and if the results are valuable enough, then I need some financial support to continue those.

### [Candle Simulation for BuyerSeller](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15ttX-8GWDTBGmYZ5E-HzIvQ3zw8eNW8NPtQP_gU7CB8/)
On a candle plot with a timewindow, with a maxitems, and with three SMA periods of [short, mid, long], let’s calculate the pnl for buyer and seller. Parameters are timewindow, maxItems, smaShort, smaMid, smaLong, and unitVolume.

### [BuyerSeller Strategy](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16Rdu1P4fBURC-qDNZ25SAkEY9xpgbHfCZibB54oF10U/)
This is my first strategy for crypto trading. It is automating buy or sell activities, so save me from watching the market hours to buy or sell the coin. Some summaries for this strategy are: Buyer strategy only buy, and Seller strategy only sell, and they don’t mixed up. If a trader launches the Buyer or Seller, the strategy completes the transaction. Means the trader have to decide which strategy to run in a given time. BuyerSeller strategy will listen to the market data to find the best buy/sell time, and it can take hours to complete the transaction, if there’s no proper opportunity found.

### [The reason why I cannot find right job](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1P77QRRM9-NHzt9LgRVX_kU3-swzoy2JSqe9lWpzVK6o/)
I was working in the financial industry for 15 years, and it feels like suddenly I have no job opportunities to apply. Why is that? (...) The self-employed crypto trader is enjoyable, but there are missing pieces in this life.

### [My Competitiveness in Financial Industry](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1D8CnpBr7l2ef13bJkrIlhdTa32pU1cxldei3J7-HcRY/)
I worked for the financial industry for 15 years by now, and I’ve been a developer and a performance engineer during this time, and later I built a refutation as an MMS analysis for KRX market. The developer career has faded out, as I had less time to work on that area, and my C++ skill rusted out time ago. So I am now a performance and MMS analyst, but it seems pretty hard to explain myself in the job market. Why is that? I felt strange recently, so I decided to list my strengths in this area.

### [Seattle, MMS and Performance Analysis Framework](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WUYW7BbkG8n0uFBlC92N4_ZW6yfXywNiCN83NcU9rHA/)
The Seattle is a python and pandas tool set for data analysis, I’ve used for the last few years. Over the time, I’ve come up with some conclusions for the recurring issues at my job, MMS analysis, which is handling lots of different data from the production market. All these conclusions are melted in this package in the form of the classes.
