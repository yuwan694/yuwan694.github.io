The echo-review is my personal endeavour for continuous learning, evaluation, and verification of knowledge available publicly. But sometimes I put a lot of time and effort into creating documents, and if the results are valuable enough, then I need some financial support to continue those.

### [Candle Simulation for BuyerSeller](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15ttX-8GWDTBGmYZ5E-HzIvQ3zw8eNW8NPtQP_gU7CB8/)
On a candle plot with a timewindow, with a maxitems, and with three SMA periods of [short, mid, long], let’s calculate the pnl for buyer and seller. Parameters are timewindow, maxItems, smaShort, smaMid, smaLong, and unitVolume.

### [BuyerSeller Strategy](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16Rdu1P4fBURC-qDNZ25SAkEY9xpgbHfCZibB54oF10U/)
This is my first strategy for crypto trading. It is automating buy or sell activities, so save me from watching the market hours to buy or sell the coin. Some summaries for this strategy are: Buyer strategy only buy, and Seller strategy only sell, and they don’t mixed up. If a trader launches the Buyer or Seller, the strategy completes the transaction. Means the trader have to decide which strategy to run in a given time. BuyerSeller strategy will listen to the market data to find the best buy/sell time, and it can take hours to complete the transaction, if there’s no proper opportunity found.
