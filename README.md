# Echo Reviews

### [Crypto Exchange API in Australia](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vT2OWT2km43mUTpmIXZ5ouVKNTmKR42Bqo8JMY6JvuX4BosMKBu156sD-haQAI4urvvnd5Of6aYkcdy/pub)
After evaluation of the Alpaca SDK, I’d like to see the other APIs available in Australia. To get in to the deeper evaluation, I need to open live account. But that requires me entering my personal details, and also official documents, like driving license, passport, etc. Alpaca is based on US, so I felt unsure about doing this with Australian documents. This is the major reason I’m looking for Australian Crypto Exchange. Also Alpaca is a kind of broker, not an exchange. So this time I’d like to use an exchange API


### [Retirement Money Spending Simulation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vSCoJ6lVJEBrWnhhnrF-16-wzdbKJ0LziqYdtx_b1l-zeaTwBPYPNUqUwKiYRdVoaN4M39YV0bZ-6nv/pub)
I’d like to echo-review the statement “With investment return of 8%, and inflation rate of 3%, the $1m invested can last 30 years, while you spending $61k per year”

### [InfinityFree WordPress Publishing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vStF8kLlgj0SeDV53oVXHiBDX67xv2waptEhepkH7C15izunJd10OV8s9mrTr-M7YVa4m_xHzZh6US2/pub)
For echo-review contents, I am evaluating a WordPress Publishing on InfinityFree. And they have an unlimited free web hosting service.

### [Using Google Docs and GitHub Pages for Echo Review](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vRmkWbMAaz_aHAcn-63dwsrTFuEzq7jbCoOzm1Xq9u3uioUhSdJfPYZw5jWU__U1gNd9gD0V1p-e7c6/pub)
GitHub Pages are providing an easy way to make static web pages. I’ll use this for the echo-review home page, and each review content will be published by the Google Docs to Web feature.
