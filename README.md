# Echo Reviews

### [Echo-Review Tools (ervTools) Python Package](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vRJk1UCyUG5eshAMjtI57gzkd4Bwf6oBooKaNB8ETQI_dP2dM8QbxlaZ4_nbxVD39VxyFm9SN1Whs9R/pub)
While I was doing echo-review for Alpaca Crypto Bar Market Data, I realised I needed to write the common tools python package for Echo Reviews. With this package, I’ll generate standard library documents and register to pip registry

### [Retirement Money Spending Simulation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vSCoJ6lVJEBrWnhhnrF-16-wzdbKJ0LziqYdtx_b1l-zeaTwBPYPNUqUwKiYRdVoaN4M39YV0bZ-6nv/pub)
I’d like to echo-review the statement “With investment return of 8%, and inflation rate of 3%, the $1m invested can last 30 years, while you spending $61k per year”

### [VSCode Extension for Unit Test](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vQDoSAk7cFIkyfUVZ-vzg4MB0Fax_XKz_f2yOcyW_PJ3lB95XqxGCdtX4uObwgwmTcmGcvo_1wHutW8/pub)
As I have shown in the Alpaca Crypto Bar Market Data echo-review, it is very useful having the unit test class in the same script with the implementation class, and if you can run each unit test right away from the code.

### [Alpaca Crypto Bar Market Data](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vSbO0Z71FGjZoAHNtqJCIjSdJyvg8Num48C_SKdutLMPdZa9bkfKp11N0Pjbe9GuUlmEgL1ekTcB3qz/pub)
The very first Alpaca SDK evaluation is about getting Crypto Bar Market Data from alpaca service. The implementation class is CryptoBar, and I made the initialisation function to take all the key word arguments as the spec for the class. So that the caller can specify the different requests when constructing the CryptoBar class.

### [Using VSCode for Python](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vTO0qs19g1TFRSKFeg3Rdo4wpBodCBolCwpk0rNY4CK8aSoPDoYtAsH2OM4Ozzr_nEp4f1uOR1GYurt/pub)
This is part of the evaluation of alpaca sdk, and I’ll start using VSCode for the python repo created for it. During the creation of the python repo, I just used the command line and web interface, but in actual development I have used VSCode since 2023. The previous tool I’ve used PyCharm from JetBrains was also good, but I think VSCode is better.

### [InfinityFree WordPress Publishing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vStF8kLlgj0SeDV53oVXHiBDX67xv2waptEhepkH7C15izunJd10OV8s9mrTr-M7YVa4m_xHzZh6US2/pub)
For echo-review contents, I am evaluating a WordPress Publishing on InfinityFree. And they have an unlimited free web hosting service.

### [Using Google Docs and GitHub Pages for Echo Review](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vRmkWbMAaz_aHAcn-63dwsrTFuEzq7jbCoOzm1Xq9u3uioUhSdJfPYZw5jWU__U1gNd9gD0V1p-e7c6/pub)
GitHub Pages are providing an easy way to make static web pages. I’ll use this for the echo-review home page, and each review content will be published by the Google Docs to Web feature.

### [Create a new repo for a python project](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vTC_sEQaTS1hDEwW21iwXDcCElZQb0jiNG4RPP-5gmwDHSZU-L6OtyiP1SRTMVHN8ObO2AvS7r9R_uM/pub)
I’ll create a new repo for Alpaca SDK evaluation, but any python package repo could be started in the same way. I’ll use a virtual environment for a python project, and will add minimal necessary files in the beginning. In this case, I’ll use GitLab for the remote repo service.
