# Echo Reviews

### [Go Compiler Bug Story](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vQFpHi76A_Bu714e9QD5YR2inZJIfo8ELAzQ5D_0s4y4-yBJRkemompeBD_fS2ymAwM2bZJICtPUvb7/pub)
When I read this article, another bug tracing story, I found I really like to follow these kinds of stories. Because I enjoy seeing the progress, and moreover I can understand what they are doing, and I also would do the same things if I were them.

### [Interactive Learning](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vRLs4t51d79K9GPph_rGTnIrNntbPthskspb-vOP8T22u-OInsdzVVT3sknkulxPaIf1D7T5MKEFB6L/pub)
To fill in the missing pieces in Self-employed Crypto Trader, I’ll consider some interactive learning courses in the community, part-time jobs and volunteer jobs.

### [Anthropic AI Issues and Explanation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vRlNKZQFtDjQ_6xHwFkYD4rTy8mbQfVj2bSZqpDKHPTW3kMa8r_x8sp8EvssSTNI4InXkXfIPe8lg57/pub)
When I saw this article, A postmortem of three recent issues, in the hackers news, I felt immensely curious. What are the issues and how do they handle it? It would definitely be very different from the traditional software service development anyway.

### [Crypto Exchange API in Australia](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vT2OWT2km43mUTpmIXZ5ouVKNTmKR42Bqo8JMY6JvuX4BosMKBu156sD-haQAI4urvvnd5Of6aYkcdy/pub)
After evaluation of the Alpaca SDK, I’d like to see the other APIs available in Australia. To get in to the deeper evaluation, I need to open live account. But that requires me entering my personal details, and also official documents, like driving license, passport, etc. Alpaca is based on US, so I felt unsure about doing this with Australian documents. This is the major reason I’m looking for Australian Crypto Exchange. Also Alpaca is a kind of broker, not an exchange. So this time I’d like to use an exchange API

### [Retirement Money Spending Simulation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vSCoJ6lVJEBrWnhhnrF-16-wzdbKJ0LziqYdtx_b1l-zeaTwBPYPNUqUwKiYRdVoaN4M39YV0bZ-6nv/pub)
I’d like to echo-review the statement “With investment return of 8%, and inflation rate of 3%, the $1m invested can last 30 years, while you spending $61k per year”

### [InfinityFree WordPress Publishing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vStF8kLlgj0SeDV53oVXHiBDX67xv2waptEhepkH7C15izunJd10OV8s9mrTr-M7YVa4m_xHzZh6US2/pub)
For echo-review contents, I am evaluating a WordPress Publishing on InfinityFree. And they have an unlimited free web hosting service.

### [Using Google Docs and GitHub Pages for Echo Review](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vRmkWbMAaz_aHAcn-63dwsrTFuEzq7jbCoOzm1Xq9u3uioUhSdJfPYZw5jWU__U1gNd9gD0V1p-e7c6/pub)
GitHub Pages are providing an easy way to make static web pages. I’ll use this for the echo-review home page, and each review content will be published by the Google Docs to Web feature.

### [Seattle, MMS and Performance Analysis Framework](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WUYW7BbkG8n0uFBlC92N4_ZW6yfXywNiCN83NcU9rHA/)
The Seattle is a python and pandas tool set for data analysis, I’ve used for the last few years. Over the time, I’ve come up with some conclusions for the recurring issues at my job, MMS analysis, which is handling lots of different data from the production market. All these conclusions are melted in this package in the form of the classes.
